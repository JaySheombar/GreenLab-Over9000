\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this article we study the relation between performance score given by lighthouse and the energy consumption of a web app. We designed an experiment with performance score as a factor and three different treatment levels according to the performance category. After performing the experiment we can conclude that web apps with a poor score consume more energy than web apps with good and average scores. The performance score would be a good guiding factor for the first few optimzations of the web app's energy consumption if the web app's performance is poor. Once the web app's performance crosses this treshhold to the average performance level, more specialized methods should be used to guide development for energy consumption.

This experiment could be extended performing an analysis on the score of each of the audits used to give a performance score. This way it would be possible to know which audit affects more to the energy consumption and developers could focus on its improvement to reduce energy consumption.

Another possible extension to the study could be done by using different benchmark web apps. So it would be possible to know which performance benchmarking tool gives a more precise score to estimate energy consumption.
